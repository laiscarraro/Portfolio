# Genetic Algorithm and Music!

In this repository, you'll find an application of Genetic Algorithm in Music.

The program starts by playing a song, a sequence of notes - which is defined inside the code -, and starts generating random sequences of notes with that same length. Then, it calculates the fitness of each sequence, and it plays the best fit. Lastly, it gets that best fit and uses as a seed for another generation of not-so-random sequences of notes, and so on, until it finds the exact same song it played on the beginning. In the end, it plays a little happy song.
